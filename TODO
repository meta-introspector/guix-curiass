* Add "BuildSteps" table like in Hydra.
This will prevent package dependencies to be built multiple times.

* Add a user account section.
- Add customized monitoring dashboards.
- Add build failures notifications subscription page.
- Add a substitutes availability service, so that users can be notified when
  the substitutes coverage of their manifest is passing a threshold.
