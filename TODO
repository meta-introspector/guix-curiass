#+STARTUP: content hidestars

* Notify instead of polling

  - 'register' notifies 'remote-server' of available builds
  - 'remote-server' notifies 'remote-worker' processes of available builds
  - 'web' notifies 'register' of build requests

* Make =remote-worker= more dynamic

  - replace fixed =--workers= option with something based on current load (?)

* Improve the user interface

** Clarify the new success/failure/queued figures on eval page
** Colorize build logs

With client-side JS; folding of build phases, etc.

* Add Guix Build Coordinator backend

* Use Spritely Goblins

  - make it possible to hand over capabilities to invidivual agents
